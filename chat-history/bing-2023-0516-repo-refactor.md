> Is there any way that make time order of these changes intuitive, so that readers can understand?
> The original commit messages are sorted by commit datetime in descending order.

Yes, one way to make the time order of the changes more intuitive is to reverse the order of the dates in the changelog so that the most recent changes are at the bottom. This way, readers can read the changelog from top to bottom in chronological order. Hereâ€™s an example of what the updated changelog would look like:

    # Changelog
