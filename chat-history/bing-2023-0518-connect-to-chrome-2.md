To run the http server when the vscode extension is activated, you can add the following code to your extension’s `activate` function:

    import * as http from 'http';
    
    const port = 54321;
    
    const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
        // Handle incoming requests here
        console.log(`Received request: ${req}`);
    });
    
    server.listen(port, () => {
        console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
    });
    

Copy

To send a message from the TamperMonkey script to the http server in the vscode extension, you can use the `fetch` function in your TamperMonkey script to make a `POST` request to the http server with the message as the request body:

    fetch('http://localhost:54321', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Hello from Tampermonkey!' }),
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
    })
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            // Handle response data here
            console.log(data);
        });
    

Copy

To send a message from the vscode extension to the TamperMonkey script, you can use a WebSocket connection between the two. You can create a WebSocket server in your vscode extension and connect to it from your TamperMonkey script. Then you can use the `send` method on the WebSocket object to send messages between the two.

> How to register the command of createServer in vscode extension?

To register a command in a vscode extension, you can use the `vscode.commands.registerCommand` function. Here’s an example of how you can register a command to create an http server:

    import * as vscode from 'vscode';
    import * as http from 'http';
    
    const port = 54321;
    
    function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
        let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('extension.createServer', () => {
            const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
                // Handle incoming requests here
                console.log(`Received request: ${req}`);
            });
    
            server.listen(port, () => {
                console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
            });
        });
    
        context.subscriptions.push(disposable);
    }
    
    exports.activate = activate;
    

Copy

In this example, we register a command with the identifier `extension.createServer`. When this command is executed (e.g. by running it from the command palette), it will create an http server listening on the specified port.

You can then add this command to your extension’s `package.json` file in the `contributes.commands` section so that it is available to users:

    "contributes": {
        "commands": [
            {
                "command": "extension.createServer",
                "title": "Create Server"
            }
        ]
    }
    

Copy

After adding this to your `package.json` file and reloading your extension, the `Create Server` command should be available in the command palette. When you run it, it will create an http server listening on the specified port.

> How to make TamperMonkey Script run without refresh the webpage?

TamperMonkey scripts are executed when the page loads. If you want to run a TamperMonkey script without refreshing the page, you can use one of the following methods:

1.  **Use the `GM_registerMenuCommand` function**: This function allows you to register a custom menu command in the TamperMonkey menu. When the user clicks on this command, the specified function will be executed. Here’s an example:

    // ==UserScript==
    // @name         My Script
    // @namespace    http://tampermonkey.net/
    // @version      1
    // @description  My script description
    // @match        *://*/*
    // @grant        GM_registerMenuCommand
    // ==/UserScript==
    
    function myFunction() {
        // Your code here
    }
    
    GM_registerMenuCommand('Run My Function', myFunction);
    

Copy

In this example, we register a menu command with the label `Run My Function`. When the user clicks on this command in the TamperMonkey menu, the `myFunction` function will be executed.

2.  **Use a browser event**: You can use a browser event such as a button click or a keyboard shortcut to trigger the execution of your TamperMonkey script. Here’s an example that uses a keyboard shortcut:

    // ==UserScript==
    // @name         My Script
    // @namespace    http://tampermonkey.net/
    // @version      1
    // @description  My script description
    // @match        *://*/*
    // ==/UserScript==
    
    function myFunction() {
        // Your code here
    }
    
    document.addEventListener('keydown', event => {
        if (event.key === 'F2') {
            myFunction();
        }
    });
    

Copy

In this example, we add an event listener for the `keydown` event on the `document` object. When the user presses the `F2` key, the `myFunction` function will be executed.

These are two ways you can run a TamperMonkey script without refreshing the page. Is there anything else you would like to know?

> How to make the changes to TamperMonkey work immediately without refreshing?

When you make changes to a TamperMonkey script, the changes will not take effect until the next time the script is executed. This means that if you want the changes to take effect immediately, you will need to refresh the page or navigate to a new page that matches the script’s `@match` pattern.

However, there is a way to make changes to a TamperMonkey script take effect immediately without refreshing the page. You can use the `@run-at` directive to specify when the script should be executed. By setting the value of this directive to `document-idle`, the script will be executed after the page has finished loading and all other scripts have finished executing.

Here’s an example:

    // ==UserScript==
    // @name         My Script
    // @namespace    http://tampermonkey.net/
    // @version      1
    // @description  My script description
    // @match        *://*/*
    // @run-at       document-idle
    // ==/UserScript==
    
    // Your code here
    

Copy

In this example, we add the `@run-at document-idle` directive to the script’s metadata block. This means that the script will be executed after the page has finished loading and all other scripts have finished executing.

After adding this directive and saving your changes, you can use the `Ctrl + R` keyboard shortcut (or `Cmd + R` on macOS) to reload your TamperMonkey scripts without refreshing the page. This will cause your changes to take effect immediately.

> How to make the TamperMonkey script use a local version so that it could be updated with local editor?

TamperMonkey allows you to use a local file as the source for a script. This means that you can edit the script using your local editor and the changes will be reflected in TamperMonkey without having to copy and paste the code.

Here’s how you can set up a local file as the source for a TamperMonkey script:

1.  **Create a local file**: Create a new file on your computer and add your TamperMonkey script code to it. Make sure to include the script’s metadata block at the top of the file.
    
2.  **Enable local file access**: In order for TamperMonkey to access local files, you need to enable the `Allow access to file URLs` option in TamperMonkey’s settings. To do this, go to the TamperMonkey dashboard, click on the `Settings` tab, and check the `Allow access to file URLs` option.
    
3.  **Install the local script**: In TamperMonkey, click on the `Utilities` tab and scroll down to the `File` section. Click on the `Choose File` button and select your local script file. Then click on the `Install` button to install the script.
    

After completing these steps, your TamperMonkey script will be using your local file as its source. Whenever you make changes to the local file and save them, TamperMonkey will automatically update the script and apply the changes.

Is there anything else you would like to know?

> Provide the metadata for specifying the local path of the TamperMonkey script.

I’m sorry for any confusion. TamperMonkey does not support specifying the local path of a script in its metadata. The method I mentioned earlier, where you can use the `Utilities` tab in the TamperMonkey dashboard to install a local script file, is the correct way to use a local file as the source for a TamperMonkey script.

Once you have installed the local script file using the `Utilities` tab, TamperMonkey will automatically detect changes to the file and update the script accordingly. You do not need to specify the local path of the script in its metadata.

Is there anything else you would like to know?

> You could use the grammer of `@require file://` to implement this.

You are correct. The `@require` directive can be used to include external scripts in a TamperMonkey script. You can use the `file://` protocol to specify the local path of a script file on your computer.

Here’s an example of how you can use the `@require` directive to include a local script file in a TamperMonkey script:

    // ==UserScript==
    // @name         My Script
    // @namespace    http://tampermonkey.net/
    // @version      1
    // @description  My script description
    // @match        *://*/*
    // @require      file:///C:/path/to/local/script/file
    // ==/UserScript==
    
    // Your code here
    

Copy

In this example, we use the `@require` directive to include a local script file located at `C:/path/to/local/script/file`. When the TamperMonkey script is executed, the contents of the local script file will be included and executed as well.

Please note that in order for this to work, you need to enable the `Allow access to file URLs` option in TamperMonkey’s settings, as mentioned earlier.

> How to make TamperMonkey script re-require script and run when a keyboard shortcut is typed?

TamperMonkey does not provide a built-in way to re-require a script or reload a `@require`d script when a keyboard shortcut is typed. However, you can achieve a similar effect by using a combination of techniques.

One way to do this is to use the `GM_xmlhttpRequest` function to fetch the contents of the local script file and then use the `eval` function to execute the fetched code. You can then add an event listener for the `keydown` event on the `document` object and trigger this process when the desired keyboard shortcut is typed.

Here’s an example that shows how you can do this:

    // ==UserScript==
    // @name         My Script
    // @namespace    http://tampermonkey.net/
    // @version      1
    // @description  My script description
    // @match        *://*/*
    // @grant        GM_xmlhttpRequest
    // ==/UserScript==
    
    const localScriptPath = 'file:///C:/path/to/local/script/file';
    
    function reloadLocalScript() {
        GM_xmlhttpRequest({
            method: 'GET',
            url: localScriptPath,
            onload: response => {
                eval(response.responseText);
            }
        });
    }
    
    document.addEventListener('keydown', event => {
        if (event.key === 'F2') {
            reloadLocalScript();
        }
    });
    

Copy

In this example, we define a `reloadLocalScript` function that uses the `GM_xmlhttpRequest` function to fetch the contents of the local script file and then uses the `eval` function to execute the fetched code. We also add an event listener for the `keydown` event on the `document` object and call the `reloadLocalScript` function when the user presses the `F2` key.

Please note that using the `eval` function can be dangerous and should be done with caution. Make sure that you trust the source of the code that you are executing with `eval`.

Is there anything else you would like to know?

> When running the script, it says "GM_httpRequest is not defined".
> Please fix this.

The error message “GM\_httpRequest is not defined” indicates that the `GM_httpRequest` function is not available in the current context. This is likely because the `GM_httpRequest` function is not a valid TamperMonkey API function.

The correct function name is `GM_xmlhttpRequest`, not `GM_httpRequest`. To fix this error, you should replace `GM_httpRequest` with `GM_xmlhttpRequest` in your script.

In addition, you need to make sure that you have included the `@grant GM_xmlhttpRequest` directive in your script’s metadata block. This directive tells TamperMonkey to grant your script access to the `GM_xmlhttpRequest` function.

Here’s an example that shows how to use the `GM_xmlhttpRequest` function correctly:

    // ==UserScript==
    // @name         My Script
    // @namespace    http://tampermonkey.net/
    // @version      1
    // @description  My script description
    // @match        *://*/*
    // @grant        GM_xmlhttpRequest
    // ==/UserScript==
    
    GM_xmlhttpRequest({
        method: 'GET',
        url: 'https://www.example.com',
        onload: response => {
            console.log(response.responseText);
        }
    });
    

Copy

In this example, we use the `GM_xmlhttpRequest` function to make a `GET` request to `https://www.example.com`. When the request completes, we log the response text to the console.
