With the info below, you should provide the flow and steps for me, to develop a prototype of a vscode extension named GPT-DevFlow.

The main features of GPT-DevFlow are:
[1] Interact with the website of Bing AI Chat in Edge and Chrome Browser, including send texts to the input text areas in Bing Chat, and receive responses from the Browser.
[2] This extension is mainly focused on Programming, so it would have some features designed specific for coding generation and improvements.

<br>

GPT-DevFlow has two main components, Input-Processor and Output-Processor, whose features are numbered in brackets of alphabets:
[1] Input Processor:
  [a] Use the vscode native editor, which has all kinds of features for text editing;
  [b] but also has a widget to quickly type predefined prompts templates for Browser Input text area.
[2] Output Processor:
  [a] Receive and format the responsed texts from Browser, which support markdown format highlight;
  [b] Copy code blocks, or dump it to local files, or run it in a sandbox; 
[3] Action Agent:
  [a] Logger: Save Chat History to local files.
  [b] Logger: Results and errors of running the code blocks from Output Processor.
  [c] Version Control: Record and diff the original codes and improved lines.
  [d] Act: Generate templated texts according to the  to Input Processor, which would be sent to Bing Chat after user provide some improvements.

With the info above, you should provide the flow and steps for me to develop a prototype of this extension.


Could I develop GPT-DevFlow with Python? And I want to use JavaScript or TypeScript as less as possible.


I have both `npm` and `pnpm` installed in my PC, which one should I use when develop this vscode extension?

How to upgrade `npm` to latest version?

What does this error mean: "npm WARN EBADENGINE Unsupported engine"

When I run `npm -v`, this error appears:
"npm WARN cli npm v9.6.6 does not support Node.js v16.6.1. This version of npm supports the following node versions: `^14.17.0 || ^16.13.0 || >=18.0.0`. You can find the latest version at https://nodejs.org/."

Please fix it for me.


What are the relationships among `nvm`, `node` and `npm`?
