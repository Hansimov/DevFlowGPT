The content below in triple backticks are the commit messages (each line per commit) of my vscode plugin DevFlowGPT.
Please generate a "changelog.md" for me with the commit messages in triple backticks.
[1] You should not replicate the commit messages line by line, but you should make them human-friendly readable sentences the changelog.
[2] You can combine adjacent similar or relative commit messages into one change log.
[3] Your output content should also be included in triple backticks.

The date format should be `YYYY-MM-DD`.

Is there any way that make time order of these changes intuitive, so that readers can understand?
The original commit messages are sorted by commit datetime in descending order.


I also want to pin the latest changes at the top, so other developers could know the progress of this project. Could you make this for me?


Great! But I'd like to put the datetime of latest change at the beginning of line and also included in brackets, whose format is like: "[<Datetime>] <Log>"

Great! But the verbs should not use past tense, which means end with "ed" and so on.
You should modify them with present tense.
An example: Change "Added" to "Add".
