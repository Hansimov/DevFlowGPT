Below is typescript codes for creating a websocket server in vscode extension.
What if I want to use the instance created from WebSocketServer class in other scripts?

<code>
import * as ws from 'ws';

export class WebSocketServer {
    private _wss: ws.WebSocket.Server | undefined;
    private _port: number = 54321;
    private _url: string = `ws://127.0.0.1:${this._port}/`;

    public start() {
        this._wss = new ws.WebSocket.Server({ port: this._port });

        this._wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
            console.log(`√ Client connected: ${this._url}`);

            ws.on('message', (message) => {
                console.log('> Received message from client:', message.toString());
            });

            ws.send('Hello from VSCode extension!');
            ws.on('error', (error) => {
                console.log(`× Error: ${error}`);
            });

            ws.on('close', () => {
                console.log(`√ Client closed: ${this._url}`);
            });
        });
    }

    public stop() {
        if (this._wss) {
            this._wss.close();
            this._wss = undefined;
        }
    }
}
</code>


Great! Then how to send message to client which is connected to this websocket server?

Here is the code for websocket client in TamperMonkey.
How to keep websocket client alive?

<code>
(function () {
    const port = 54321;
    const ws_url = `ws://127.0.0.1:${port}/`;

    // WebSocket Client
    let ws = new WebSocket(ws_url);

    ws.addEventListener('open', function (event) {
        console.log(`√ Connected server: ${ws_url}`);
        ws.send('Hello from TamperMonkey!');
    });

    ws.addEventListener('message', function (event) {
        console.log('> Received:', event.data);
    });

    ws.addEventListener('error', function (event) {
        console.log('× Error:', event);
    });

    ws.addEventListener('close', function (event) {
        console.log(`√ Closed server: ${ws_url}`);
    });

})();
</code>


In the `extension.ts` of vscode extension which creates the websocket server,
this line `ws.sendMessageToClients()` does not send the message.
Please fix the issue.

<code>
let ws = new WebSocketServer();
ws.start();
ws.sendMessageToClients("New Message from VSC");
</code>


Great! But I would like to send message to client util the connection is established.


Fine. But I would like to use the `sendMessageToClients()` in `extension.ts`, and also send once the connection is successfully established.
