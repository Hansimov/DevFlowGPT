The code you provided is the metadata block for a Tampermonkey script. It provides information about the script such as its name, version, and author. It also specifies the websites the script will run on and any external resources it requires.

To create a websocket server to communicate with a vscode extension, you’ll need to add additional code to your script. This code will depend on the specifics of your websocket server and vscode extension. Can you provide more details about what you want your websocket server and vscode extension to do?

> Yes! I would like to receive and send texts between tampermonkey and vscode extension.

To send and receive text between a Tampermonkey script and a VSCode extension, you can use the WebSocket API to establish a connection between the two. Here’s an example of how you might do this:

In your Tampermonkey script:

    // Create a WebSocket connection
    const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');
    
    // Connection opened
    socket.addEventListener('open', function (event) {
        // Send a message to the VSCode extension
        socket.send('Hello from Tampermonkey!');
    });
    
    // Listen for messages from the VSCode extension
    socket.addEventListener('message', function (event) {
        console.log('Message from VSCode extension:', event.data);
    });
    

Copy

In your VSCode extension:

    const WebSocket = require('ws');
    
    // Create a WebSocket server
    const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });
    
    // Listen for connections
    wss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {
        // Listen for messages from the Tampermonkey script
        ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {
            console.log('Message from Tampermonkey:', message);
        });
    
        // Send a message to the Tampermonkey script
        ws.send('Hello from VSCode extension!');
    });
    

Copy

This is just an example to get you started. You’ll need to adapt it to fit your specific needs.

> When running `const socket = new WebSocket(ws_url);`,

> 
> <error>
> Socket connection to 'ws://localhost:54321/' failed: 
> Error with Permissions-Policy header: Unrecognized feature: 'ch-ua-form-factor'.
> </error>

The error message you provided suggests that there is an issue with the Permissions-Policy header. The `ch-ua-form-factor` feature is not recognized.

The Permissions-Policy header allows a site to control which features and APIs can be used in the browser. The `ch-ua-form-factor` feature is related to the User-Agent Client Hints API, which allows developers to access information about the user’s device form factor (e.g., mobile, desktop) in a privacy-preserving manner.

It’s possible that the site you’re trying to connect to has a misconfigured Permissions-Policy header that includes an unrecognized feature. You may want to check the site’s documentation or contact their support team for assistance.

Alternatively, you could try connecting to a different WebSocket server to see if the issue persists.

> 
> <error>
> Socket connection to 'ws://localhost:54321/' failed:

> DevTools failed to load source map: Could not load content for chrome-extension://gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom/browser-polyfill.js.map: System error: net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND
> </error>

The first part of the error message you provided suggests that there is an issue with the Permissions-Policy header. The `ch-ua-form-factor` feature is not recognized.

The Permissions-Policy header allows a site to control which features and APIs can be used in the browser. The `ch-ua-form-factor` feature is related to the User-Agent Client Hints API, which allows developers to access information about the user’s device form factor (e.g., mobile, desktop) in a privacy-preserving manner.

It’s possible that the site you’re trying to connect to has a misconfigured Permissions-Policy header that includes an unrecognized feature. You may want to check the site’s documentation or contact their support team for assistance.

The second part of the error message you provided indicates that DevTools failed to load a source map for `browser-polyfill.js`. This error is unrelated to the WebSocket connection issue and should not affect the functionality of your script. Source maps are used by DevTools to map minified code back to its original source code, making it easier to debug. The error message suggests that the source map file could not be found. This could happen if the file was deleted or moved, or if there is an issue with the extension that provides it.

You can safely ignore this error if you’re not using DevTools to debug your script.

> Does websocket support one to many communication?

Yes, WebSocket supports one-to-many communication. This is commonly achieved by using a WebSocket server to relay messages between multiple clients.

When a client connects to a WebSocket server, the server can keep track of the connection and add it to a list of connected clients. When the server receives a message from one client, it can iterate over the list of connected clients and send the message to each one. This allows one client to send a message to many other clients through the WebSocket server.

Here’s an example of how this might be implemented on the server side:

    const WebSocket = require('ws');
    
    const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });
    
    // Keep track of connected clients
    const clients = new Set();
    
    wss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {
        // Add the new client to the set of clients
        clients.add(ws);
    
        ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {
            // Broadcast the message to all connected clients
            for (const client of clients) {
                // Don't send the message back to the sender
                if (client !== ws && client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
                    client.send(message);
                }
            }
        });
    
        ws.on('close', function close() {
            // Remove the client from the set of clients
            clients.delete(ws);
        });
    });

This is just an example to illustrate the concept. You’ll need to adapt it to fit your specific needs.

Here’s an example of how you might create a WebSocket server in a VSCode extension to communicate with the Tampermonkey script you provided:

    const WebSocket = require('ws');
    
    // Set the port number
    const port = 54321;
    
    // Create a WebSocket server
    const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: port });
    
    // Listen for connections
    wss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {
        console.log(`√ Client connected on: ws://127.0.0.1:${port}/`);
    
        // Listen for messages from the Tampermonkey script
        ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {
            console.log('> Received message from Tampermonkey:', message);
        });
    
        // Send a message to the Tampermonkey script
        ws.send('Hello from VSCode extension!');
    
        ws.on('close', function close() {
            console.log(`√ Client closed on: ws://127.0.0.1:${port}/`);
        });
    });
    

Copy

This code creates a WebSocket server that listens on the specified port. When a client (in this case, the Tampermonkey script) connects to the server, it logs a message to the console and listens for incoming messages from the client. It also sends a greeting message to the client.

You’ll need to adapt this code to fit your specific needs and integrate it into your VSCode extension.

> Suppose I want to implement this feature in a `httpServer.ts` TypeScript in vscode extension.
> Please provide me the code `httpServer.ts` and register the command in `extension.ts`.

Here’s an example of how you might implement a WebSocket server in a `httpServer.ts` file in a VSCode extension:

    import * as WebSocket from 'ws';
    
    export class HttpServer {
        private _wss: WebSocket.Server;
    
        constructor(port: number) {
            this._wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: port });
    
            this._wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
                console.log(`√ Client connected on: ws://127.0.0.1:${port}/`);
    
                ws.on('message', (message) => {
                    console.log('> Received message from Tampermonkey:', message);
                });
    
                ws.send('Hello from VSCode extension!');
    
                ws.on('close', () => {
                    console.log(`√ Client closed on: ws://127.0.0.1:${port}/`);
                });
            });
        }
    }
    

Copy

This code defines a `HttpServer` class that creates a WebSocket server when instantiated. The server listens on the specified port and logs messages to the console when clients connect, send messages, or disconnect.

To use this class in your `extension.ts` file, you’ll need to import it and create an instance of it when your extension is activated. Here’s an example of how you might do this:

    import * as vscode from 'vscode';
    import { HttpServer } from './httpServer';
    
    export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
        // Set the port number
        const port = 54321;
    
        // Create a new HttpServer instance
        const httpServer = new HttpServer(port);
    
        // Register a command to start the server
        let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('extension.startServer', () => {
            vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`WebSocket server started on port ${port}.`);
        });
    
        context.subscriptions.push(disposable);
    }
    
    export function deactivate() {}
    

Copy

This code imports the `HttpServer` class and creates an instance of it when the extension is activated. It also registers a command named `extension.startServer` that displays an information message when invoked.

You’ll need to adapt this code to fit your specific needs and integrate it into your VSCode extension.

> Great! But you should do following improvements:
> [1] The websocket server should be launched when the vscode extension is activated, and be closed when the vscode extension is deactivated.
> [2] Make the port and websocket url `ws://127.0.0.1:${port}` to a separate variable, so that it could be changed easily.

Sure! Here’s an updated version of the `httpServer.ts` and `extension.ts` files that incorporates your suggestions:

`httpServer.ts`:

    import * as WebSocket from 'ws';
    
    export class HttpServer {
        private _wss: WebSocket.Server | undefined;
    
        constructor(private _port: number, private _url: string) {}
    
        public start() {
            this._wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: this._port });
    
            this._wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
                console.log(`√ Client connected on: ${this._url}`);
    
                ws.on('message', (message) => {
                    console.log('> Received message from Tampermonkey:', message);
                });
    
                ws.send('Hello from VSCode extension!');
    
                ws.on('close', () => {
                    console.log(`√ Client closed on: ${this._url}`);
                });
            });
        }
    
        public stop() {
            if (this._wss) {
                this._wss.close();
                this._wss = undefined;
            }
        }
    }
    

Copy

This version of the `HttpServer` class takes two additional parameters in its constructor: the port number and the WebSocket URL. These values are stored as private properties of the class and can be accessed and used throughout the class.

The class also includes two new methods: `start()` and `stop()`. The `start()` method creates a new WebSocket server and sets up event listeners, while the `stop()` method closes the server if it is running.

`extension.ts`:

    import * as vscode from 'vscode';
    import { HttpServer } from './httpServer';
    
    let httpServer: HttpServer;
    
    export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
        // Set the port number and WebSocket URL
        const port = 54321;
        const url = `ws://127.0.0.1:${port}/`;
    
        // Create a new HttpServer instance
        httpServer = new HttpServer(port, url);
    
        // Start the server
        httpServer.start();
    
        // Register a command to start the server
        let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('extension.startServer', () => {
            vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`WebSocket server started on port ${port}.`);
        });
    
        context.subscriptions.push(disposable);
    }
    
    export function deactivate() {
        // Stop the server
        httpServer.stop();
    }
    

Copy

This version of the `extension.ts` file sets the port number and WebSocket URL as separate variables, making it easier to change them if needed. It also creates a new `HttpServer` instance and calls its `start()` method when the extension is activated. When the extension is deactivated, it calls the `stop()` method to close the server.

I hope these changes meet your requirements!

> Great! But you should do following improvement:
> Wrap the port and url into the class HttpServer, I don't like to make it exposed in `extension.ts`.

Sure! Here’s an updated version of the `httpServer.ts` and `extension.ts` files that incorporates your suggestion:

`httpServer.ts`:

    import * as WebSocket from 'ws';
    
    export class HttpServer {
        private _wss: WebSocket.Server | undefined;
        private _port: number = 54321;
        private _url: string = `ws://127.0.0.1:${this._port}/`;
    
        public start() {
            this._wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: this._port });
    
            this._wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
                console.log(`√ Client connected on: ${this._url}`);
    
                ws.on('message', (message) => {
                    console.log('> Received message from Tampermonkey:', message);
                });
    
                ws.send('Hello from VSCode extension!');
    
                ws.on('close', () => {
                    console.log(`√ Client closed on: ${this._url}`);
                });
            });
        }
    
        public stop() {
            if (this._wss) {
                this._wss.close();
                this._wss = undefined;
            }
        }
    }
    

Copy

This version of the `HttpServer` class defines the port number and WebSocket URL as private properties of the class, with default values of `54321` and `ws://127.0.0.1:54321/`, respectively. These values are not exposed outside of the class and can only be accessed and used within the class.

`extension.ts`:

    import * as vscode from 'vscode';
    import { HttpServer } from './httpServer';
    
    let httpServer: HttpServer;
    
    export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
        // Create a new HttpServer instance
        httpServer = new HttpServer();
    
        // Start the server
        httpServer.start();
    
        // Register a command to start the server
        let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('extension.startServer', () => {
            vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`WebSocket server started.`);
        });
    
        context.subscriptions.push(disposable);
    }
    
    export function deactivate() {
        // Stop the server
        httpServer.stop();
    }
    

Copy

This version of the `extension.ts` file creates a new `HttpServer` instance without passing any arguments to its constructor. The default values for the port number and WebSocket URL defined in the `HttpServer` class are used.

I hope this change meets your requirement!

> Great! But you should do following improvement:
> Rename the filename of `httpServer.ts` and the class name of `HttpServer` so that the filename and class name could be consistent with the features in the script.

Sure! Here’s an updated version of the `httpServer.ts` file that incorporates your suggestion:

`webSocketServer.ts`:

    import * as WebSocket from 'ws';
    
    export class WebSocketServer {
        private _wss: WebSocket.Server | undefined;
        private _port: number = 54321;
        private _url: string = `ws://127.0.0.1:${this._port}/`;
    
        public start() {
            this._wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: this._port });
    
            this._wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
                console.log(`√ Client connected on: ${this._url}`);
    
                ws.on('message', (message) => {
                    console.log('> Received message from Tampermonkey:', message);
                });
    
                ws.send('Hello from VSCode extension!');
    
                ws.on('close', () => {
                    console.log(`√ Client closed on: ${this._url}`);
                });
            });
        }
    
        public stop() {
            if (this._wss) {
                this._wss.close();
                this._wss = undefined;
            }
        }
    }
    

Copy

This version of the file renames the `HttpServer` class to `WebSocketServer` to better reflect its purpose. The filename has also been changed from `httpServer.ts` to `webSocketServer.ts` to match the new class name.

You’ll need to update your `extension.ts` file to import the `WebSocketServer` class from the new `webSocketServer.ts` file and create an instance of it when your extension is activated. Here’s an example of how you might do this:

`extension.ts`:

    import * as vscode from 'vscode';
    import { WebSocketServer } from './webSocketServer';
    
    let webSocketServer: WebSocketServer;
    
    export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
        // Create a new WebSocketServer instance
        webSocketServer = new WebSocketServer();
    
        // Start the server
        webSocketServer.start();
    
        // Register a command to start the server
        let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('extension.startServer', () => {
            vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`WebSocket server started.`);
        });
    
        context.subscriptions.push(disposable);
    }
    
    export function deactivate() {
        // Stop the server
        webSocketServer.stop();
    }
    

Copy

This version of the `extension.ts` file imports the `WebSocketServer` class from the `webSocketServer.ts` file and creates an instance of it when the extension is activated.

I hope these changes meet your requirements!

> when running `import * as WebSocket from 'ws';`

The error message you provided suggests that the TypeScript compiler is unable to find the `ws` module or its type declarations. This can happen if the `ws` module is not installed or if its type declarations are not included in your project.

To fix this issue, you’ll need to install the `ws` module and its type declarations. You can do this by running the following command in your project’s root directory:

    npm install --save ws @types/ws
    

Copy

This will install the `ws` module and its type declarations as dependencies of your project. Once the installation is complete, you should be able to import the `WebSocket` class from the `ws` module without encountering any errors.

If you’re still encountering issues after installing the `ws` module and its type declarations, please let me know and I’ll do my best to help.

> When compiling `webSocketServer.ts`, it gives the following error:

The first error message you provided suggests that the TypeScript compiler is unable to find the `ws` module or its type declarations. This can happen if the `ws` module is not installed or if its type declarations are not included in your project.

To fix this issue, you’ll need to install the `ws` module and its type declarations. You can do this by running the following command in your project’s root directory:

    npm install --save ws @types/ws
    

Copy

This will install the `ws` module and its type declarations as dependencies of your project. Once the installation is complete, you should be able to import the `WebSocket` class from the `ws` module without encountering any errors.

The second and third error messages you provided suggest that the TypeScript compiler is unable to infer the types of the `ws` and `message` parameters in your event listeners. This can happen if the `ws` module is not installed or if its type declarations are not included in your project.

Once you’ve installed the `ws` module and its type declarations as described above, these errors should be resolved. The TypeScript compiler will be able to infer the types of the `ws` and `message` parameters based on the type declarations provided by the `@types/ws` package.

If you’re still encountering issues after installing the `ws` module and its type declarations, please let me know and I’ll do my best to help.

The error message you provided suggests that the `ws` module could not be found when your VSCode extension was activated. This can happen if the `ws` module is not installed or if it is not included in your extension’s `node_modules` directory.

To fix this issue, you’ll need to make sure that the `ws` module is installed and included in your extension’s `node_modules` directory. Here’s how you can do this:

1.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your extension’s root directory (the directory that contains your `package.json` file).
2.  Run the following command to install the `ws` module and its type declarations:

    npm install --save ws @types/ws
    

Copy

This will install the `ws` module and its type declarations as dependencies of your extension. The `ws` module will be added to your extension’s `node_modules` directory.

3.  Make sure that the `ws` module is included in your extension’s `.vsix` package when you package and publish your extension. You can do this by including the `node_modules` directory in your `.vsix` package or by using a bundler like webpack to bundle your extension’s dependencies into a single file.

Once you’ve completed these steps, the `ws` module should be available when your extension is activated and you should no longer encounter this error.

If you’re still encountering issues after following these steps, please let me know and I’ll do my best to help.

> What if i want to create a websocket client with TypeScript in the vscode extension?

To create a WebSocket client in a VSCode extension using TypeScript, you can use the `ws` module. Here’s an example of how you might do this:

    import * as WebSocket from 'ws';
    
    // Set the WebSocket URL
    const url = 'ws://example.com/';
    
    // Create a new WebSocket connection
    const ws = new WebSocket(url);
    
    // Connection opened
    ws.on('open', () => {
        // Send a message to the server
        ws.send('Hello from VSCode extension!');
    });
    
    // Listen for messages from the server
    ws.on('message', (data) => {
        console.log('> Received message from server:', data);
    });
    

Copy

This code creates a new WebSocket connection to the specified URL. When the connection is opened, it sends a greeting message to the server. It also listens for incoming messages from the server and logs them to the console.

You’ll need to adapt this code to fit your specific needs and integrate it into your VSCode extension.

Make sure that you have the `ws` module installed in your project by running `npm install --save ws @types/ws` in your project’s root directory.

> When vscode extension connecting to tampermonkey script with websocket, it returns Buffer instead of string:
> 
> <log>
> Received message from Tampermonkey: Buffer(24) [72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 32, 102, 114, 111, 109, 32, 84, 97, 109, 112, 101, 114, 109, 111, 110, 107, 101, 121, 33, buffer: ArrayBuffer(30), byteLength: 24, byteOffset: 6, length: 24, Symbol(Symbol.toStringTag): 'Uint8Array']
> </log>

The log message you provided suggests that the data received by the WebSocket client in your VSCode extension is a `Buffer` object rather than a string. This can happen if the data sent by the Tampermonkey script is not a string.

To convert the `Buffer` object to a string, you can use its `toString()` method. Here’s an example of how you might do this in your WebSocket client code:

    // Listen for messages from the server
    ws.on('message', (data) => {
        // Convert the data to a string
        const message = data.toString();
    
        console.log('> Received message from Tampermonkey:', message);
    });
    

Copy

This code listens for incoming messages from the server and converts the received data to a string using the `toString()` method. The resulting string is then logged to the console.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
