Here are the steps you can follow to develop a prototype of the GPT-DevFlow extension:

1.  **Set up your development environment**: Install Visual Studio Code and the necessary tools for developing extensions.
    
2.  **Create a new extension**: Use the `yo code` command to generate a new extension project.
    
3.  **Implement the Input Processor**:
    
    -   Use the vscode native editor API to create a text editor for the user to input text.
    -   Create a widget to quickly type predefined prompts templates for Browser Input text area.
4.  **Implement the Output Processor**:
    
    -   Use the vscode API to receive and format the responsed texts from Browser, which support markdown format highlight.
    -   Implement functions to copy code blocks, dump it to local files, or run it in a sandbox.
5.  **Implement the Action Agent**:
    
    -   Create a logger to save Chat History and results and errors of running the code blocks from Output Processor to local files.
    -   Implement version control to record and diff the original codes and improved lines.
    -   Implement an act function to generate templated texts according to the Input Processor, which would be sent to Bing Chat after user provide some improvements.
6.  **Test your extension**: Test your extension in Visual Studio Code to ensure that it works as expected.
    
7.  **Package and publish your extension**: Package your extension and publish it to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
    

I hope this helps you get started with developing your GPT-DevFlow extension! Let me know if you have any further questions. 😊

> Could I develop GPT-DevFlow with Python? And I want to use JavaScript or TypeScript as less as possible.

Yes, you can develop the GPT-DevFlow extension using Python. Visual Studio Code extensions can be developed using any language that can be transpiled to JavaScript or TypeScript. You can use a tool like `pyodide` to run Python code in the browser and interact with the Visual Studio Code API.

However, keep in mind that some parts of the extension development process, such as packaging and publishing the extension, may still require the use of JavaScript or TypeScript. You can minimize the use of these languages by using existing tools and libraries to handle these tasks. 😊

> I have both `npm` and `pnpm` installed in my PC, which one should I use when develop this vscode extension?

Both `npm` and `pnpm` can be used to manage dependencies and run scripts when developing a Visual Studio Code extension. `npm` is the default package manager for Node.js and is widely used in the JavaScript community. `pnpm` is an alternative package manager that aims to provide faster and more efficient package installations.

You can use either `npm` or `pnpm` when developing your GPT-DevFlow extension. The choice between the two depends on your personal preference and development workflow. If you’re already familiar with one of the package managers, it may be easier to stick with it. Otherwise, you can try both and see which one works best for you. 😊

> How to upgrade `npm` to latest version?

You can upgrade `npm` to the latest version by running the following command in your terminal:

    npm install -g npm@latest
    

Copy

This will install the latest version of `npm` globally on your system. After the installation is complete, you can verify that `npm` has been updated by running `npm -v` to check its version.

Keep in mind that upgrading `npm` may also update some of its dependencies, so make sure to read the release notes and changelog before upgrading to ensure that there are no breaking changes that may affect your development workflow. 😊

> What does this error mean: "npm WARN EBADENGINE Unsupported engine"

The “npm WARN EBADENGINE Unsupported engine” warning message indicates that the version of Node.js you are using is not supported by one or more of the packages you are trying to install.

Each package can specify the versions of Node.js that it supports in its `package.json` file using the `engines` field. If the version of Node.js you are using does not meet the requirements specified by a package, `npm` will display this warning message.

To resolve this issue, you can either upgrade or downgrade your version of Node.js to one that is supported by the package, or you can try to find an alternative package that supports your current version of Node.js. 😊

> When I run `npm -v`, this error appears:
> "npm WARN cli npm v9.6.6 does not support Node.js v16.6.1. This version of npm supports the following node versions: `^14.17.0 || ^16.13.0 || >=18.0.0`. You can find the latest version at https://nodejs.org/."
> 
> Please fix it for me.

The error message you’re seeing indicates that the version of `npm` you’re using (v9.6.6) does not support the version of Node.js you have installed (v16.6.1). According to the error message, this version of `npm` supports Node.js versions `^14.17.0`, `^16.13.0`, or `>=18.0.0`.

To fix this issue, you can either upgrade your version of Node.js to one that is supported by your current version of `npm`, or you can downgrade your version of `npm` to one that supports your current version of Node.js.

To upgrade your version of Node.js, you can visit the Node.js website at https://nodejs.org/ and download and install the latest version that is supported by your current version of `npm`. Alternatively, you can use a Node.js version manager like `nvm` to easily switch between different versions of Node.js.

To downgrade your version of `npm`, you can run the following command in your terminal:

    npm install -g npm@<version>
    

Copy

Replace `<version>` with the desired version of `npm` that supports your current version of Node.js.

> in windows, user environment variable and  system variable which is first used?

In Windows, when a process looks up an environment variable, it first checks the user environment variables. If the variable is not found in the user environment variables, the process then checks the system environment variables.

User environment variables are specific to the user account that is currently logged in, while system environment variables apply to all users on the computer. This means that if a user sets a user environment variable with the same name as a system environment variable, the user environment variable will take precedence and be used by processes running under that user account.

In summary, user environment variables are checked first and take precedence over system environment variables. 😊

> If the Powershell in lauched in Admin mode, then which variable would be checked first?

When PowerShell is launched in Admin mode (also known as “elevated mode”), it still checks the user environment variables first, followed by the system environment variables.

Even when running in Admin mode, PowerShell is still associated with a user account, and the user environment variables for that account are checked first. If the variable is not found in the user environment variables, PowerShell then checks the system environment variables.

In summary, even when running in Admin mode, PowerShell still checks the user environment variables first, followed by the system environment variables. 😊

> What are the relationships among `nvm`, `node` and `npm`?

`nvm` (Node Version Manager) is a tool that allows you to easily install and manage multiple versions of `node` (Node.js) on the same system. `npm` (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js and is used to install and manage packages (libraries and tools) for use in Node.js projects.

The relationship between these three tools is as follows:

-   `nvm` is used to install and manage different versions of `node`.
-   Each version of `node` comes with a specific version of `npm`.
-   `npm` is used to install and manage packages for use in Node.js projects.

In summary, `nvm` is used to manage `node` versions, and each version of `node` comes with a specific version of `npm`, which is used to manage packages for Node.js projects. 😊
