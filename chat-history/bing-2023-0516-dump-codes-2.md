# When I run a vscode exten...

> When I run a vscode extension, it shows this error:
> ```
> rejected promise not handled within 1 second: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'Untitled-1'
> ```
> Please explain the reason of this error and fix it for me.

This error message indicates that the extension is trying to open a file named ‘Untitled-1’ but it cannot find it. The `ENOENT` error code stands for “Error NO ENTry” or “Error NOt a Directory”, which means that the file or directory you’re trying to access doesn’t exist.

Can you tell me more about the extension you’re trying to run and the steps you took before encountering this error? This will help me better understand the issue and provide a solution. 😊

I’m sorry, but the code you provided doesn’t seem to be related to the error message you mentioned earlier. The error message indicates that a file named ‘Untitled-1’ cannot be found, but there is no reference to such a file in the code you provided.

Can you please provide more information about the context in which this error occurs? For example, what are the steps to reproduce this error? Are there any other files or code involved? This will help me better understand the issue and provide a solution. 😊

Based on the code you provided, it doesn’t seem to be the cause of the error message you mentioned earlier. The error message indicates that a file named ‘Untitled-1’ cannot be found, but there is no reference to such a file in the code you provided.

It’s possible that the error is occurring in another part of your code or in another file. Can you please provide more information about the context in which this error occurs? For example, what are the steps to reproduce this error? Are there any other files or code involved? This will help me better understand the issue and provide a solution. 😊

Thank you for providing more information about the error. Based on the stack trace you provided, it seems that the error is occurring in the `buuug7.gbk2utf8` extension. Specifically, it’s happening in the `extension.js` file of that extension.

It’s possible that this error is caused by a bug in the `buuug7.gbk2utf8` extension. You could try updating the extension to the latest version or contacting the extension’s developer for support.

Alternatively, you could try disabling the `buuug7.gbk2utf8` extension and see if that resolves the issue. 😊
