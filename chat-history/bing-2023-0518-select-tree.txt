Make the following TypeScript codes more readable for human:

<code>
const files = await vscode.workspace.findFiles('**/*', excludePattern);
const fileItems = files.map(file => ({ label: path.relative(workspaceFolder.uri.fsPath, file.fsPath).replace(/\\/g, '/'), file })).sort((a, b) => a.label.localeCompare(b.label));
const newSelectedFiles = await vscode.window.showQuickPick(fileItems, { placeHolder: 'Select files', canPickMany: true });
</code>


In vscode "extension.ts", how to run a command in extension when the window is open?


Here are the commands in `package.json`, if I want the extension auto run the `devflowgpt.selectFile` when window is reloaded, how to do it?
<code>
  "contributes": {
    "commands": [
      {
        "command": "devflowgpt.sendMessage",
        "title": "DevFlowGPT: Send Message to Chrome Browser"
      },
      {
        "command": "devflowgpt.selectFile",
        "title": "DevFlowGPT: Select Files to Dump"
      }
    ]
  },
</code>



I add this line into the script, but the command still not executed.


There is a log: "The extension is not activated because no Vitest environment was detected."


What does this line in `package.json` do for vscode extension?

<code>
"activationEvents": [],
</code>


I want the extension to be activated when the window is reloaded, how to do it?


Using '*' activation is usually a bad idea as it impacts performance. You should try to be more specific about when your extension should be activated.

What is the vscode extension command for open a folder as workspace in current window?


What is the return type of `vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders?.[0];`


How to specify a workspaceFolder using an uri?


The codes below gives me error "No workspace folder is opened":

<code>
const uri = vscode.Uri.file("C:/_codes/GPT-DevFlow");
const workspaceFolder = vscode.workspace.getWorkspaceFolder(uri);
if (!workspaceFolder) {
    vscode.window.showErrorMessage('No workspace folder is opened');
    return;
}
</code>


Here is my current codes, however, it opens no folder:
<code>
// const workspaceFolder = vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders?.[0];
const uri = vscode.Uri.file("C:/_codes/GPT-DevFlow");
// vscode.commands.executeCommand('vscode.openFolder', uri, false);
// const workspaceFolder = vscode.workspace.getWorkspaceFolder(uri);
const workspaceFolder: vscode.WorkspaceFolder = { uri, name: 'DevFlowGPT', index: 0 };
if (!workspaceFolder) {
    vscode.window.showErrorMessage('No workspace folder is opened');
    return;
}
</code>
