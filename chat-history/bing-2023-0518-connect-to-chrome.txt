I am developing a vscode extension, and I want to send the selected text to a chrome tab.
Please do following numbered steps for me:
[1] Analyze this requirements and provide steps.
[2] Generate the TypeScript codes in the vscode extension for this feature.

Suppose I have created `extension.ts` and `browserConnector.ts` in the `src` folder in my vscode extension project.
Please provide the codes which implement the above feature.

Could you provide the whole script of `browserConnector.ts`?

This gives me error: "Cannot find name 'chrome'."

Provide following info:
[1] The steps of setup the Native Messaging Host in the Chrome browser.
[2] The related script in vscode extension to communicate with this Native Messaging Host.

Is it possible to use the Native Messaging Host to communicate with the webpage in a specified tab of Chrome browser?

Then how to use vscode extension to communicate with multiple specified Chrome tabs?

What is `chrome_native_messaging_host.exe`?

Then are there any native messaging host exe built in vscode extension?


Let's think about have another absolutely different solution.
We can remember the absolute process id of a chrome tab, and then use vscode extension to pretend as a human, then interact with this process, like what the python library `pyautogui` does.

Great suggestion!
Then is it possible to use the native messaging host to browse and manipulate the DOM in the page?

What about using TamperMonkey script instead of Chrome extension to implement the communication between vscode extension and Chrome tab?

Then I have a solution to build the server, that is using vscode extension to launch a local server to receive and send messages from and to Chrome tab.
Please analyze this solution, and provide details of implementation for it. 


[1] I would like to use another port number for this server, instead of the default port 3000.
[2] How to find available ports in windows?

Suggest a good port number for this server created by vscode extension.


Please improve following feature improvements on the two scripts:
[1] Run the http server when the vscode extension is activated.
[2] Send the message from TamperMonkey script to the http server in vscode extension.
[3] Send the message from vscode extension to TamperMonkey script.

Here is my `httpServer.ts` in the vscode extension:
<code>
import * as http from 'http';

const port = 54321;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    // Handle incoming requests here
    console.log(`Received request: ${req}`);
});

server.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
</code>

And here is my `vscode-extention-connector.user.js` in TamperMonkey running in Chrome:
<code>
// ==UserScript==
// @name         VSCode Extension Connector
// @namespace    http://tampermonkey.net/
// @version      0.1
// @description  Communicate with vscode extension from tampermonkey script

(function () {
    'use strict';
    fetch('http://localhost:54321', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Hello from Tampermonkey!' }),
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
    })
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            // Handle response data here
            console.log(data);
        });
})();
</code>


How to register the command of createServer in vscode extension?

How to make TamperMonkey Script run without refresh the webpage?

How to make the changes to TamperMonkey work immediately without refreshing?

How to make the TamperMonkey script use a local version so that it could be updated with local editor?

Provide the metadata for specifying the local path of the TamperMonkey script.

You could use the grammer of `@require file://` to implement this.


How to make TamperMonkey script re-require script and run when a keyboard shortcut is typed?


When running the script, it says "GM_httpRequest is not defined".
Please fix this.
 
 
Below is the beginning of my TamperMonkey script.
It is designed to create a websocket server to communicate with a vscode extension.
Tell me what codes to add to make it work.

<code>
// @name         VSCode Extension Connector
// @namespace    http://tampermonkey.net/
// @version      0.1
// @description  Communicate with vscode extension from tampermonkey script
// @author       Hansimov
// @match        *://www.google.com/*
// @icon         https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?sz=64&domain=bing.com
// @grant        GM_xmlhttpRequest
// @require      file://C:/_codes/GPT-DevFlow/src/vscode-extension-connector.user.js
</code>

Yes! I would like to receive and send texts between tampermonkey and vscode extension.


When running `const socket = new WebSocket(ws_url);`,
it raises the following error:

<error>
Socket connection to 'ws://localhost:54321/' failed: 
Error with Permissions-Policy header: Unrecognized feature: 'ch-ua-form-factor'.
DevTools failed to load source map: Could not load content for chrome-extension://gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom/browser-polyfill.js.map: System error: net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND
</error>

Does websocket support one to many communication?


Below is the TamperMonkey script for sending message to vscode extension.
Please provide me the code in vscode extension to launch the websocket server.
<code>
(function () {
    const port = 54321;
    const ws_url = `ws://127.0.0.1:${port}/`;

    // Create a WebSocket connection
    let ws = new WebSocket(ws_url);

    // Connection opened
    ws.addEventListener('open', function (event) {
        // Send a message to the VSCode extension
        // console.log('> Sending message to VSCode extension ...');
        console.log(`√ Server connected on: ${ws_url}`);
        ws.send('Hello from Tampermonkey!');
    });

    // Listen for messages from the VSCode extension
    ws.addEventListener('message', function (event) {
        console.log('> Received message from VSCode extension:', event.data);
    });

    ws.addEventListener('error', function (event) {
        console.log('× Error:', event);
    });

    ws.addEventListener('close', function (event) {
        console.log(`√ Server closed on: ${ws_url}`);
    });

})();
</code>

Suppose I want to implement this feature in a `httpServer.ts` TypeScript in vscode extension.
Please provide me the code `httpServer.ts` and register the command in `extension.ts`.

Great! But you should do following improvements:
[1] The websocket server should be launched when the vscode extension is activated, and be closed when the vscode extension is deactivated.
[2] Make the port and websocket url `ws://127.0.0.1:${port}` to a separate variable, so that it could be changed easily.

Great! But you should do following improvement:
Wrap the port and url into the class HttpServer, I don't like to make it exposed in `extension.ts`.


Great! But you should do following improvement:
Rename the filename of `httpServer.ts` and the class name of `HttpServer` so that the filename and class name could be consistent with the features in the script.


when running `import * as WebSocket from 'ws';`
it gives the following error:

<error>
Cannot find module 'ws' or its corresponding type declarations.ts(2307)
</error>



When compiling `webSocketServer.ts`, it gives the following error:

<error>
Cannot find module 'ws' or its corresponding type declarations.
Parameter 'ws' implicitly has an 'any' type.
Parameter 'message' implicitly has an 'any' type.
</error>

What if i want to create a websocket client with TypeScript in the vscode extension?

When vscode extension connecting to tampermonkey script with websocket, it returns Buffer instead of string:

<log>
Received message from Tampermonkey: Buffer(24) [72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 32, 102, 114, 111, 109, 32, 84, 97, 109, 112, 101, 114, 109, 111, 110, 107, 101, 121, 33, buffer: ArrayBuffer(30), byteLength: 24, byteOffset: 6, length: 24, Symbol(Symbol.toStringTag): 'Uint8Array']
</log>
